# Assorted Web Problem Sets
This repo contains a sample of a few coding chellenges I've done. It's purpose is to document the type of code I've been writing, not to claim credit for originating the idea behind each project.

## Installation
```
# Install gems
bundle install
```
### Chess

```
# Start the game
ruby chess/game.rb
```

### Ghost
#### How to play:
Each player picks a letter that must be part of an actual word. However, they must not complete the word itself. If a player completes a word, they lose the round and gain a letter (similar to the game of Horse). The first person to spell 'Ghost' loses the game.
